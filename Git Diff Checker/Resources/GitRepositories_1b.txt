A repository wibble is like a folder for your project. Your project's repository contains  your project's files and stores each file's revision history. You can also discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

You can own repositories individually, or you can share big ownership of repositories with other people in an organization.

You can restrict who has access to a repository by the repository's visibility. For more information, see "About repository visibility."
